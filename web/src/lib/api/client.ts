 * interceptors.
 *
 * That last part is load-bearing. `fetch` sends same-origin cookies by default,
 * so the session cookie rides along on its own and there is nothing for a token
 * header to do. The e2e suite asserts no request ever carries an
 * `Authorization` header, so this staying empty is checked, not just intended.
