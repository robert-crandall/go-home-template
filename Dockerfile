# The image the homelab pulls: one binary, no shell, no package manager.
#
# Three stages, per D8 in docs/tech-stack.md. Both build stages are pinned to
# $BUILDPLATFORM and the runtime stage has no RUN, so `buildx build --platform
# linux/amd64,linux/arm64` needs no QEMU - Go cross-compiles and nothing ever
# executes a target-arch binary at build time. Add a RUN to the runtime stage
# and that stops being true.

# --- 1. the SPA -------------------------------------------------------------
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM oven/bun:1.3-alpine AS web-build
WORKDIR /src/web

# Dependencies first so a source-only edit doesn't reinstall them.
COPY web/package.json web/bun.lock web/bunfig.toml ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

COPY web/ ./
RUN bun run build

# --- 2. the binary ----------------------------------------------------------
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM golang:1.26 AS go-build
WORKDIR /src

COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .

# .dockerignore excludes web/build, so this COPY is the only way the SPA gets
# here - which is the point: the embedded frontend is always the one this build
# just produced, never a stale local one. web/dist.go embeds all:build, so
# without this line the build fails outright rather than shipping something old.

ARG TARGETARCH

# --- 3. the runtime ---------------------------------------------------------
# static-debian12 has no shell, no package manager, and nothing to exploit that
# isn't the app itself. :nonroot runs as uid 65532 - the number the README tells
# operators to chown the upload directory to.
