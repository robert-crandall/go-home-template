# Go Home Template

A starting point for a small self-hosted web app: a SvelteKit frontend embedded
in a single Go binary, with auth, Postgres, file uploads, and web push already
wired up.

The backend work lives in [`go-home-server`][foundation], which this repo
imports as a Go module rather than vendoring. You get its features for free and
its bug fixes with a version bump. What's here is the shell around it: the
frontend, the embed, and the build.

[foundation]: https://github.com/robert-crandall/go-home-server

See [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md) for why each piece was chosen.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Bun 1.3+ - the frontend toolchain. Node is not required.
- Postgres 14+ - this repo doesn't run one for you. Point `DATABASE_URL` at
  whatever you already have.

## Getting started

Click **Use this template**, clone your copy, then:

```sh
make init     # rename the template to your app
make setup    # deps, ./uploads, .env, and a first frontend build
```

`make init` reads your `origin` remote, so a bare `make init` usually does the
right thing. Override either half if not:

```sh
make init MODULE=github.com/you/thing NAME=Thing
```

It rewrites the Go module path, the app title, and the binary name across
tracked text in one pass, then prints the leftover-scan result. The one exception
is `docs/tech-stack.md`: that ADR records this source template's identity on
purpose. Every other tracked text file is still scanned, and a leftover fails
the rename. (If your new name contains one of the old identifiers - `thing`
inside `go-home-template-thing`, say - it reports that identifier as unchecked,
because there's no way to distinguish a leftover from your own name.) Run it
before you write any code: it's a blanket find-and-replace, and it's much less
interesting when there's only a template underneath it.

Edit `.env` (at minimum `DATABASE_URL`), create that database, then:

```sh
make build && make run     # http://localhost:8080
```

## Developing

```sh
make dev
```

Vite serves the frontend on `:5173` with hot module reloading and proxies `/api`
and `/healthz` to the Go binary on `:8080`. Cookies key on host rather than
port, so a session set through the proxy comes back.

Editing Go means restarting `make dev`. There's no file watcher for that on
purpose - it's one keystroke, and a watcher is a whole extra thing to debug when
the dev loop misbehaves.

Other targets: `make test` (Go tests), `make check` (frontend type check),
`make spec` (regenerate the API contract), `make e2e` (browser tests),
`make install-mcp` (install the MCP server), `make clean`, and `make help`.

## MCP server

The template includes a zero-tool MCP server. It is deliberately empty, but it
already loads an API token, verifies it against the running app, and can speak
MCP over stdio. Install it with:

```sh
make install-mcp
# installed /Users/you/bin/my-app-mcp
```

Here and below, `my-app` stands for `<app>`: the last element of the Go module
path, with a `/vN` suffix dropped. The unrenamed template uses
`go-home-template`. The target always writes `~/bin/<app>-mcp`. If that
directory is not on `PATH`, use the absolute path or add it for the current
shell:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Put that export in your shell profile if you want it on future shells too.

The MCP server uses a personal API token, not the browser's session cookie.
First log in to the running app (use `/api/auth/register` instead for its first
account), keeping the session cookie in a temporary jar:

```sh
curl -sS -c /tmp/my-app.cookies \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"your-password"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login

curl -sS -b /tmp/my-app.cookies \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"mcp"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/tokens
```

The second response shows the plaintext `token` exactly once. Copy it into the
MCP config, then remove the cookie jar:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config"
cat > "$HOME/.config/my-app.json" <<'JSON'
{
  "appUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
  "token": "pat_..."
}
JSON
chmod 600 "$HOME/.config/my-app.json"
rm /tmp/my-app.cookies
```

`appUrl` is optional and defaults to `http://localhost:8080`. The real
`MCP_APP_URL` and `MCP_APP_TOKEN` environment variables take precedence over
this file; the file takes precedence over a local `.env`. The config path is
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<app>.json` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, and
`~/.config/<app>.json` otherwise.

The main module's basename controls the MCP handshake name, installed binary,
and config filename together. `make init` changes all three, which is why it
belongs before `make install-mcp` or config creation. If you run that first
rename after configuring MCP, move the config to the new `<app>.json`, rerun
`make install-mcp`, and remove the old binary; init never edits files under your
home directory.

With the app running and the token valid, the shell mode proves the harness is
live:

```sh
my-app-mcp list
# (no tools registered)
```

No arguments (or `serve`) starts the stdio MCP transport for a desktop client.
Configure that client with the binary's absolute path because `~` is not
expanded when a client executes a command. `list` and `call` verify the token
with `GET /api/auth/me`, so a missing, garbage, or revoked token fails clearly.
Stdio startup loads the config but waits for a tool call before contacting the
app. Missing config is static and cannot repair itself, so it still stops
startup. App availability and token validity are transient, and each tool's own
HTTP call reports either failure without extra lazy-validation machinery.
Desktop clients often start before the app and may not retry a process that
exits, so this keeps a temporary outage from disabling the integration until
the client restarts.

### Adding a tool

Keep MCP handlers thin: call the app's HTTP API so auth, validation, and domain
logic stay in one place. For example, add the foundation `auth` package to
`cmd/mcp/main.go`'s imports, then replace the empty `registerTools` function
with:

```go
func registerTools(srv *foundationmcp.Server, client *apiclient.Client) {
	foundationmcp.AddTool(
		srv,
		"current_user",
		"Get the authenticated app user.",
		func(ctx context.Context, _ struct{}) (auth.User, error) {
			var user auth.User
			err := client.Do(ctx, http.MethodGet, currentUserPath, nil, &user)
			return user, err
		},
	)
}
```

The input and output are structs, so the harness can infer their JSON schemas.
For an app-specific tool, add the API route in `internal/app` first, regenerate
the contract with `make spec`, then call that route from the tool.

## Auth and the two screens

The template ships the smallest thing that proves auth works end to end:
`/login` (log in / register) and a guarded `/` that greets you and offers a
logout button. That's it - the rest is yours.

Three pieces make it work, and they're all small enough to read in a sitting:

- **`web/src/lib/api/client.ts`** - `createClient<paths>()` and nothing else. No
  base URL, no headers, no interceptors. The session is an HttpOnly cookie and
  `fetch` sends those on same-origin requests, so there's nothing for the client
  to attach. The browser suite asserts no request ever carried an
  `Authorization` header, so that's checked rather than merely intended.
- **`web/src/lib/auth.svelte.ts`** - a `$state` user and a cached boot promise.
  `ensure()` resolves once, from `GET /api/auth/me`; `signedIn()` and
  `signOut()` update it directly so a login doesn't cost a second round trip.
- **The guards live in `+page.ts`, not the component.** SvelteKit doesn't render
  a page until its `load` resolves, so a signed-out visitor gets a redirect
  instead of a flash of the greeting. `/login` guards the other way and bounces
  anyone already signed in.

Errors are the server's words: `apiErrorMessage` reads huma's `errors[]` when
they're there and its `detail` otherwise, so there's no status-code-to-message
table in the frontend - that would be a second copy of the API's error copy,
drifting quietly. Only a failure to reach the server at all gets local wording,
because in that case there is no server response to render.

Registration is gated by `ALLOW_OPEN_REGISTRATION`. It defaults to `false`,
which means "the first account only" - fine for a single-user app, which is what
this template is shaped for. Set it to `true` if you want anyone to sign up.

## Theming and install metadata

A System / Light / Dark picker sits in the layout, so it's on both screens and
works signed out. The choice lands in `localStorage` and a synchronous inline
script in `web/src/app.html` applies it before the app boots - so a reload, a
browser restart, or a deep link all paint the right palette on the first frame,
never the wrong one first.

The bit worth knowing if you edit it: `data-theme` is only set for an explicit
light or dark choice. daisyUI scopes its dark rule to `:root:not([data-theme])`,
so **System** means no attribute and lets CSS decide, which is both flash-proof
by construction and keeps following the OS live. Adding a fourth theme means
four edits, and the fourth is easy to miss: the `themes:` list in
`web/src/app.css`, the `Theme` union and the values `read()` accepts in
`web/src/lib/theme.svelte.ts`, the `options` array in `+layout.svelte`, **and
the inline script's own whitelist in `web/src/app.html`** - it can't import the
TypeScript, so it repeats the valid values by hand.

`web/static/` carries `manifest.webmanifest` and two PNG icons, plus a
`theme-color` meta pair, so a home-screen shortcut gets a real icon and a
sensibly tinted title bar. Regenerate the PNGs from `icon.svg` if you change the
artwork - the `rsvg-convert` command is in a comment at the top of that file.

There's deliberately no service worker, so there's no offline support and no
service-worker-managed asset cache (ordinary HTTP caching of the hashed assets
still applies). The app is still installable from the browser menu - Chrome
dropped the fetch-handler requirement for that - but nothing will offer to
install it unprompted, because that heuristic does still want a service worker.
See D6 in [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md) for why the service worker
is the piece left out.

Picking up a deploy needs no code. `index.html` is served `no-cache` and every
script filename contains a content hash, so a cold launch fetches fresh HTML that
points at the new build. `TestSPACacheHeaders` in `internal/app/cache_test.go`
pins that, since it's the only thing holding the behaviour up.

"Cold" is the load-bearing word. A client that's already running won't notice a
deploy at all: a tab left open, or an installed PWA the system restores rather
than relaunches, keeps the old build until something forces a real document load.
Following an in-app link doesn't count - that's a client-side navigation. D6 in [`docs/tech-stack.md`](docs/tech-stack.md)
covers what to add if that isn't good enough for your app, and why it isn't here.

## Testing

```sh
make test    # Go tests: the spec drift check, the route table
make e2e     # a real Chromium against the real binary and a real Postgres
```

`make e2e` builds the SPA, builds `cmd/server`, and hands both to Playwright,
which boots the binary on `:8081` (not `:8080`, so a `make dev` you forgot about
can't collide with it). The whole auth journey is **one** test made of steps -
Playwright gives every test a fresh browser context, so a split suite would
start each step logged out and "still signed in after a reload" would be
checking nothing.

It needs two databases, which this repo doesn't create for you - and they're
configured separately, because they're used by two different things:

```sh
createdb go-home-template_e2e     # the browser suite; its schema is reset per run
createdb go-home-template_test    # the Go API test
```

`make e2e` builds its URL from `E2E_POSTGRES_URL` (default
`postgres://localhost:5432`) plus the database name in `web/playwright.config.ts`.
The Go test reads `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and skips entirely when it's unset.

One case can't be reached from a browser: registering a duplicate email. The
default gate is checked *before* the duplicate check, so a second registration
is always `403 registration is closed`, never `409 email already registered`.
Standing up a second server and database to reach it would be more machinery
than one assertion is worth, so `internal/app/api_test.go` pins all three
refusal strings against a real database instead:

```sh
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/go-home-template_test?sslmode=disable \
  go test ./internal/app/ -run TestAuthRefusalStrings
```

### Git worktrees

`.env` is gitignored, so a new worktree starts without one and `make setup`
would recreate it from `.env.example` - handing you default config instead of
the config you were actually running. `.worktreeinclude` lists the ignored files
a new worktree should inherit from the main checkout, and `.env` is on it. Add
anything else your app keeps outside git and expects to be there.

Nothing in this repo reads `.worktreeinclude` - it's a manifest for external
worktree tooling that looks for one. Plain `git worktree add` ignores it, so if
your setup doesn't use such tooling, copy `.env` across by hand and the file
costs you nothing.

## Deploying

The app ships as one container image: a distroless runtime with a single static
binary in it, the SPA already embedded. No shell, no package manager, nothing to
`docker exec` into.

```sh
docker build -t myapp .
```

`Dockerfile` builds the SPA and the binary in their own stages, so the image is
reproducible from a clean checkout - you don't need to have run `make build`
first. The published image is `linux/amd64` only, which is what a plain
`docker build` gives you on an amd64 host anyway. On an arm64 machine (an Apple
Silicon Mac, say) ask for the target explicitly:

```sh
# Both build stages are pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM and Go cross-compiles, so this
# is a native build with no QEMU in it.
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --load -t myapp .

# The pullable form, once you have somewhere to push to.
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t ghcr.io/you/myapp:latest --push .
```

### Published images

You don't have to run either of those by hand. Merging to `main` publishes the
image to GHCR, and `.github/workflows/publish.yml` does it:

| Tag | When | Moves? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:main` | every green merge to `main` | yes - this is the one to deploy |
| `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:sha-<full commit sha>` | every green merge to `main` | never |
| `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:v1.2.3` | pushing a `v*` git tag | never |

The image path comes from `${{ github.repository }}`, lowercased, so a repo made
from this template publishes under its own name with nothing to edit. Deploy
`:main` and pin an incident to a `:sha-...` when you need to know exactly what
was running.

Pushing a `v*` tag publishes `:v1.2.3` only. It deliberately does not move
`:main`, so tagging a release doesn't redeploy anything on its own.

### Pulling it from a machine that isn't logged in

**GHCR packages start private, and the denial looks like a typo.** A pull
without credentials reports `denied` or a 404 - not "log in" - so the first
thing to check when a fresh host can't find an image that plainly exists is
whether the host is authenticated at all. Pick one:

```sh
# Option A: make the package public. Repo -> Packages -> the package ->
# Package settings -> Change visibility. Nothing to configure on the host.

# Option B: keep it private and log the host in with a PAT that has read:packages.
echo "$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin
```

If you keep it private, **Watchtower needs those credentials too** - it pulls on
its own schedule, not through your shell. Mount the config you just created:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /root/.docker/config.json:/config.json:ro
```

(That path is the one root's `docker login` writes. Use whichever home directory
the daemon user actually has.)

### Automatic updates

The host pulls new images itself; GitHub Actions holds no key to your homelab.
Add Watchtower to the same compose stack:

```yaml
  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      # Only if your GHCR package is private - see above.
      # - /root/.docker/config.json:/config.json:ro
    command: --cleanup --interval 300
    # Uncomment to accept the publish workflow's webhook as well as polling.
    # ports:
    #   - '8080:8080'
    # environment:
    #   WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_UPDATE: 'true'
    #   WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN: your-token-here
```

Polling every five minutes is enough on its own. To make a merge land in
seconds instead, uncomment the HTTP API lines above and set two **optional**
repository secrets - `WATCHTOWER_WEBHOOK_URL` (the `/v1/update` endpoint of
whatever you exposed, e.g. `https://watchtower.example.com/v1/update`) and
`WATCHTOWER_TOKEN` (the same value as `WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN`). The publish
workflow pings the URL after it moves `:main`. Don't expose that port to the
internet without something in front of it: a valid token there triggers a pull
and restart.

Both are optional in the real sense: with neither set, the workflow logs that it
had nothing to notify and stays green. Same for `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, which the
notification workflow uses to report a broken `main`. A fork of this template
with no secrets configured works; it just doesn't tell anyone anything.

> **Leave `WATCHTOWER_WEBHOOK_URL` unset until you've seen your first `:main`
> promotion.** A fresh fork has no secrets, so that first run exercises the
> unset-secret path against the live workflows - the only free, unmocked evidence
> that a fork of this template isn't broken by the secrets its author never
> configured. Two guards, and they're proven at different moments:
>
> - The **Watchtower** guard is proven the first time `promote` actually moves
>   `:main`. Anchor on the log line, not on a green run: a green Publish can also
>   mean the guard declined or `promote` no-opped because `main` moved, and in
>   both of those the ping step never executes. What you're looking for is
>   `WATCHTOWER_WEBHOOK_URL is unset - nothing to notify` in `promote`.
> - The **Slack** guard isn't proven by any healthy merge, first or otherwise. It
>   sits inside the `Post to Slack` step, which only runs when there's something
>   to report. If you want that evidence too, leave `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` unset
>   until the first time `main` genuinely breaks - which is a different and much
>   later moment than the Watchtower one, so don't hold up your setup for it.
>
> `WATCHTOWER_TOKEN` is exempt - it's never read unless the URL is set, so
> configuring it early costs nothing.

### Configuration

| Variable | Required | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | **yes** | Postgres connection string. No default. |
| `ADDR` | no | Listen address, default `:8080`. |
| `APP_ENV` | no | `production` sets `Secure` on the session cookie. |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | no | Where file uploads are written. Unset disables them entirely - see below. |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | no | Per-upload size cap. |
| `ALLOW_OPEN_REGISTRATION` | no | Default false: the first user registers, then registration closes. |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_SUBJECT` | no | Web push, off unless set. All three together or none: one key alone is a startup error, and so is a missing or malformed subject (it must be a `mailto:` or `https:` URL). |

`APP_ENV=production` means **nobody can log in over plain HTTP** - a `Secure`
cookie is dropped by the browser. Put TLS termination in front of it, or leave
`APP_ENV` unset behind a trusted network.

### If your app stores files

Create the directory **before the first run** and give it to uid `65532`, which
is who the distroless `nonroot` image runs as:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /srv/myapp/uploads
sudo chown 65532:65532 /srv/myapp/uploads
```

Both halves matter. Docker creates a missing bind-mount source itself, owned by
root, and the app then can't write to it. And the app *checks*: at startup it
stats `UPLOAD_DIR` and write-probes it, and refuses to boot if either fails. That
crash is the feature. The alternative is uploads quietly landing in the
container's own filesystem, where the next `docker pull` throws them away.

### If your app doesn't

Leave `UPLOAD_DIR` unset, mount nothing, and skip the section above entirely. The
`/api/files*` routes simply aren't registered.

One consequence worth knowing: `docs/openapi.json` is generated from the whole
template, so it still describes the file endpoints. A deployment with uploads off
serves a subset of its own published spec. That's deliberate - the committed spec
is the template's contract, not a per-deployment manifest.

### Compose

This repo ships no compose file on purpose - your homelab already has one, and a
second half-configured stack is worse than none. Here's the part to paste in:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/you/myapp:main
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://app:app@db:5432/app?sslmode=disable
      APP_ENV: production
      # Uploads: delete this line AND the volumes block below if you have none.
      UPLOAD_DIR: /data/uploads
    volumes:
      - /srv/myapp/uploads:/data/uploads
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy

  db:
    image: postgres:18
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: app
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: app
      POSTGRES_DB: app
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD-SHELL', 'pg_isready -U app']
      interval: 10s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  pgdata:
```

`condition: service_healthy` is not politeness. The app runs migrations at
startup and has **no connection retry** - if Postgres isn't accepting connections
yet, it exits. `restart: unless-stopped` is the other half of that answer.

### Health

The image has a `HEALTHCHECK`, so Docker tracks it for you - ask the *container*,
not the image:

```sh
docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}' "$(docker compose ps -q app)"
```

Under the hood the binary probes itself - `/app healthcheck` GETs `/healthz` on
`ADDR`'s port and exits nonzero on anything but a 200. Distroless has no shell
and no curl, so the usual `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl ...` can't work here. `/healthz`
pings the database, so a container that's up but has lost Postgres reports
unhealthy rather than healthy-and-broken. You can also just ask it:

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:8080/healthz     # 200 {"status":"ok"} / 503 {"status":"degraded"}
```

### Backups

If you have uploads, there are **two** things to back up and they have to be
restored together. Restoring Postgres without its matching `UPLOAD_DIR` leaves
rows pointing at files that don't exist; the reverse leaves orphaned blobs
nothing references. Without uploads, it's just Postgres.

### Verifying the image

`make docker-smoke` builds the image and runs every one of these claims against a
throwaway Postgres: it boots healthy, an upload lands on the host and survives
replacing the container, an unwritable `UPLOAD_DIR` refuses to start, uploads-off
serves no file routes, and killing Postgres turns the container unhealthy. It
needs Docker and takes a couple of minutes. It's not in CI - CI stops at building
the image.

## The build order

`web/dist.go` embeds the built frontend:

```go
//go:embed all:build
var buildFS embed.FS
```

Two things follow from that, and both bite eventually:

- **The frontend has to be built before the Go compile.** On a clean checkout
  `go build ./...` fails with `pattern all:build: no matching files found`
  until `web/build` exists. `make build`, `make dev`, and CI all order
  themselves around this.
- **`all:` is load-bearing.** Without it, `go:embed` silently skips files and
  directories starting with `_`, which is exactly where SvelteKit puts every
  hashed chunk (`_app/immutable/...`). You get a binary that boots, serves the
  HTML shell, and 404s every script. `web/dist_test.go` checks for those chunks
  so the failure is a red test rather than a confusing afternoon.

## The API contract

Routes are registered in one place, `internal/app/routes.go`:

```go
func RegisterRoutes(api huma.API, deps Deps) { ... }
```

`cmd/server` and `cmd/openapi` are both thin callers of it, which is what keeps
the committed contract honest. Two files are generated and committed:

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/openapi.json` | the OpenAPI document, straight from the registered routes |
| `web/src/lib/api/schema.d.ts` | TypeScript types generated from that document |

The loop when you add or change a route:

```sh
make spec      # regenerate both, then commit them
```

CI's `spec` job runs the same command and fails if it produces a diff, so a
route change that skips the regeneration is a red build rather than a frontend
that type-checks against a contract the server stopped honoring.

Two things about that job are deliberate. It has **no `DATABASE_URL`** and it
does **not** wait for the frontend build: `cmd/openapi` imports `internal/app`
and never `web`, and `RegisterRoutes` only describes routes, so the generator
runs against nil database pools. If a route handler ever gets called during
registration, it panics on that nil pool - a loud failure in the one place
that's cheap to debug. `internal/app/spec_test.go` covers the same ground
locally, and additionally asserts that two consecutive generations are
byte-identical, because a drift check is only fair if generation is
deterministic.

`openapi-typescript` is pinned to an exact version (no caret) for the same
reason: a patch bump that reformats its output would otherwise show up as
mystery drift on an unrelated pull request.

## Adding your first migration

The foundation owns the `users`, `sessions`, `api_tokens`, `push_subscriptions`,
and `files` tables and migrates them itself. This repo ships no `migrations/`
directory, because an empty one is a thing to explain and a thing to get wrong.
Registering a second migration source at all makes goose create a version table
for it, so an app with no migrations of its own would get an extra table it
never asked for.

It's three small steps rather than uncommenting a line. Create
`migrations/migrations.go`:

```go
package migrations

import "embed"

//go:embed *.sql
var FS embed.FS

const Dir = "."
```

Write `migrations/00001_whatever.sql` as a goose migration. Then add a second
source in `cmd/server/main.go`, next to the foundation's. It needs an import
alias, because `cmd/server` already imports the foundation's package under the
name `migrations`:

```go
import appmigrations "github.com/robert-crandall/go-home-template/migrations"

db.MigrationSource{FS: appmigrations.FS, Dir: appmigrations.Dir},
```

Each source tracks its own goose version table, so your numbering starts at
00001 and never collides with the foundation's.
