// How a deploy reaches an installed PWA. There is no code for it, and this test
// is the reason that is safe to say.
//
// Launching the app fetches index.html, which the foundation serves `no-cache`,
// so the client cannot reuse yesterday's copy without asking. Fresh HTML points
// at the new build's scripts, whose filenames contain a content hash, so they
// are fetched by virtue of being different URLs - the year-long `immutable` on
// the old ones is irrelevant because nothing asks for them any more.
//
// That entire argument rests on one header set inside go-home-server's
// setSPACacheControl, which this repo tracks as a version-pinned dependency. If
// a bump ever gave index.html a positive max-age, launching the app would keep
// showing the old build for that long and nothing else here would notice. Hence
// this test, which is deliberately about the contract rather than the exact
// string: `no-cache` or `no-store`, in any order and any case.
// Six digits is a day and a bit. The point is only that the value isn't a token
// number that would have clients re-fetching hashed assets constantly.

// (`B20NDseN.js`) or a suffix on it (`app.D8wVCmbq.js`, `0.DpqJCwbk.css`). This
// is a shape check and not a proof - `bundle12.js` would pass - but it fails
// the names a build that stopped hashing would actually produce.
